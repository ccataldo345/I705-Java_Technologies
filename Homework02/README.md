Homework 2 - Tetris FigureGenerator

Use the same JavaFX Tetris project that we wrote in practicum and implement a FigureGenerator that would create randomly all the figures in the Tetris game, but without any of the figures being predefined.

In Tetris, the figures consist of 4 blocks that are placed side-by-side in every possible way (other possibilities are just rotations of these 7 figures):

<pre>
#     #    ##    #      #     #      #
#     #    ##    ##    ##     #     ##
##    #           #     #    ##     #
      #
</pre>

Write an algorithm that would randomly create all possible blocks. Also, write a unit test for that functionality.
