Homework 5 - A fancy print method

Write a method "print" (just one method!) that would work for the following lines:

<pre>
print("Names that start with A",
  e -> e.startsWith("A"), "Mati", "Kati", "Aadu");

print("Values that are greater than ten",
  e -> e > 10, 40, 0, 4, -5, -14, 35, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8);
</pre>

The output of these lines should be:
<pre>
Names that start with A: Aadu
Values that are greater than ten: 40, 35
</pre>
